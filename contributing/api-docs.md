# Writing API docs

We use [API extractor](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/)
to generate API docs in markdown. We put the markdown files in the
[theatre-docs](https://github.com/theatre-js/theatre-docs/) repo, which also
contains the tutorials and guides.

To generate the API docs, run the `build:api-docs` from the root of the repo:

```sh
$ yarn build:api-docs /path/to/theatre-docs/docs/api/ # this will empty the /api folder and regenerate the markdown files
```

## JSDoc/TSDoc gotchas

We are using TSDoc for documentation generation, IDEs use JSDoc for tooltips.
TSDoc and JSDoc have subtle differences. We need to optimize for both.

Most users will read our documentation inside their IDEs.

### `@example`

IDEs automatically wrap example sections in ` ``` ` if they aren't already
wrapped by you. This means you can't use non-code explanations in example
sections, like TSDoc examples do.

This will be formatted incorrectly:

````ts
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 * @example
 * Here's a simple example:
 * ```
 * // Prints "2":
 * console.log(add(1,1));
 * ```
 * @example
 * Here's an example with negative numbers:
 * ```
 * // Prints "0":
 * console.log(add(1,-1));
 * ```
 */
export function add(x: number, y: number): number {}
````

Some IDEs have problems with having multiple example sections in the same JSDoc
comment.

WebStorm doesn’t highlight examples if you wrap them in ` ``` `.

api-documenter doesn’t highlight examples if you don't wrap them in ` ``` `.

### Guidelines

- Only use one `@example` section
- Use a single code block in it, no explanations
- Wrap the code block in ` ```ts ... ``` ` (the `ts` modifier is important,
  api-documenter copies the `@example` section verbatim, and our documentation
  page might not highlight the vanilla ` ``` ` sections)
- If you need to explain the code, use code comments

#### `@typeParam`

api-documenter doesn’t generate documentation for it, but IDEs might display it
even if they don't have bespoke support for it.

#### `@link`

While in JSDoc you can specify paths relative to the current declaration, TSDoc
requires everything to be specified relative to the entry point. That is, if
`bar` is a member of `Foo`, and `Foo` is exported in the entry, you need to
refer to `bar` as `Foo.bar`, even inside `Foo`.

JSDoc allows separating the link text from the link either with a space or using
`|`. TSDoc only supports `|`, _and_ you mustn’t have spaces around it. So for
example `{@link MyClass | go here}` would be rendered incorrectly, whereas
`{@link MyClass|go here}` would be correct.

#### `@param`

api-documenter won’t render the documentation for object properties, but
document them anyway, IDEs do.

Since documentation is only rendered for the object and not for its properties,
make sure to include examples for these properties.

#### `@see`

While JSDoc attempts to hyperlink to anything after the `@see` tag, TSDoc
requires an explicit `{@link}` tag tag to make hyperlinks.

**Incorrect ❌**

```ts
/**
 * Parses a string containing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
 
 * @see ParsedUrl

 * @param url - the string to be parsed
 * @returns the parsed result
 */
function parseURL(url: string): ParsedUrl
```

**Correct ✅**

```ts
/**
 * Parses a string containing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
 
 * @see {@link ParsedUrl}

 * @param url - The string to be parsed
 * @returns The parsed result
 */
function parseURL(url: string): ParsedUrl
```
